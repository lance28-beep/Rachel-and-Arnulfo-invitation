  narrative: `Once upon a time, in a small town filled with the scent of 
  old streets and tricycles buzzing around, there lived a humble sales 
  lady named Bhabes. Every day, she stood behind the counter of a modest 
  store, greeting clients with her kind smile and gentle heart. \n

One afternoon, fate walked in wearing a crisp Air Force uniform. 
His name was Bhars—a young Air Force man with a proud stance and 
a warm, steady gaze. What started as a simple window shopping 
turned into countless visits, each one filled with shy smiles and heartfelt conversations. \n

Soon, love blossomed quietly between the shelves and the sound of laughter. 
It was simple, sincere, and strong—the kind of love that could weather time and distance. \n

After they married, Bhars saw the light in Bhabes eyes whenever she 
helped the neighborhood children with their schoolwork. He encouraged 
her to dream bigger, to chase the education she once set aside. 
And with his unwavering support, Bhabes went back to school. \n

It wasn’t easy—between raising three sons, studying late at night, 
nd keeping the home together—but together they made it through. 
Eventually, Bhabes became a teacher, shaping young minds with the 
same warmth and patience that once filled her tiny store. \n

Years turned into decades. Bhars served his country with honor, 
and Bhabes served her community with love. Their three sons grew 
up watching two hearts work hand in hand—proving that true partnership 
means lifting each other higher. \n

Now, both retired, they sit side by side on their porch as the 
sun sets—she with her books, he with his stories of the skies. 
He often teases her, saying, “Who knew a simple window shopping 
could lead me to my forever?” She laughs and replies, “And who knew a 
simple sales lady could fall in love with a man who reached for the clouds?” \n

Their story is more than a love story—it’s a legacy of faith, 
perseverance, and shared dreams. A reminder that when love is built 
on respect and sacrifice, it only grows stronger through time. \n

From a store counter to the skies above, their love 
has truly soared—proof that the simplest beginnings 
can lead to the most beautiful forever. \n `,

But if you desire to give nonetheless, a monetary gift is the one we suggest.`,
